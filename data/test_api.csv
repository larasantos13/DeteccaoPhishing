1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Historically, families have usually had more children than parents,
resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in
recent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the
number of children per generation has steadily gone down, while
life span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree
that some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin,
with few people in each generation. The term ""beanpole family"" has
been around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it
rarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to
wider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it
too slangy and prefer the jargon term ""verticalised"" to describe
such families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that
the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal
relationships within the family and (for example) the role of
grandparents.The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the
'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in
divorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single
child.
                                             [""Observer"", May 2002]Noting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in
Britain (families with only one child), the report warns that a
child without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family
members of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation,
with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'.
                                            [""Guardian"", June 2002]
2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A stupid person, a blockhead.Unfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped
out of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it
that I can find is in the classic W C Fields film ""The Bank Dick""
of 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line:
""Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a
jabbernow, you're not those, are you?"". Before that, it turns up in
one of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems
to have been rather rare.It's from the old French ""jobard"", from ""jobe"", silly. That word
was then added to ""noll"", the top or crown of the head, the noddle.
The first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was
soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within.
""Jobbernowlism"" is the condition or state of being a ""jobbernowl"",
or an act or remark that is especially stupid.Careful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber!

I've been away at a heritage conference in Colchester these past
few days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign
posted above some steps at the local railway station:   Caution

   Use the hand rail
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer
electronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come
across the expression ""bells and whistles"", which seem to relate to
equipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer
as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work.
Is that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve
Castelain, France]Q. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to
gimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a
piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem
more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function.The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the
American military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in
an article in ""Atlantic"" in October 1982, which said it was
""Pentagon slang for extravagant frills"". There's some evidence that
the term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early
evidence is sparse.Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal
sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth
century, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before
modern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud
warning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam
made the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the
noisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans
will agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at
one time ""clang, clang, clang went the trolley"" in large numbers of
American cities.At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and
whistles, as this extract from an article in ""Appleton's Journal""
of 1876 shows:  You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping
  along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky
  height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by
  two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and
  whistles seems like the small diversions of very little
  children, so diminished are they by the distance.Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought
excessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a
frill?Possibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes
from that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre
organ. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer
augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to
help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns,
sirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and
organs often had ""toy counters"" with 20 or more noisemakers on
them, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades
after the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still
common in big movie houses, these fun features must have been
considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but
mere fripperies, inessential add-ons.It's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up
especially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities
to add them are so great.                        -----------Q. The designation of ""robes"" for academic dress clearly comes from
its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about
""mortarboards""? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or
13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does
""mortarboard"" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient?A. The academic cap often called a ""mortarboard"" is quite ancient,
but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth
century (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a
""square""). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually
with a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts
of mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually
call it a hawk.What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between
the brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at
Oxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our
first recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, ""The Adventures of Mr.
Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman"" by a clergyman named Edward
Bradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names
of the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school).
Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book
recounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don
appears after one such escapade: ""I will overlook your offence in
assuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave
the offensive epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especially, as you
acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have
known better"".After a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more
than 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley
invented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly
popularised it.                        -----------Q. I got into a discussion about ""chip off the old block"" with
friends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting,
jewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this
term mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan]A. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely
made of wood.The first form of the expression was ""chip of the same block"",
meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as
somebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage.
An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time
Bishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: ""Am not I a child of the same Adam
... a chip of the same block, with him?"".Later that century, another form is recorded ""a chip of the old
block"", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his
father, or continued some family characteristic. At some point,
probably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to ""a
chip off the old block"", which does nothing to change the sense,
but is the way it's now usually written or said.

"re : ter meulen 's review ter meulen , alice g . b . , ( 1997 ) representing time in natural language , the dynamic interpretation of tense and aspect , mit press , cambridge mass . , 160 pages , isbn 0-262 - 70066 - 2 , $ 12 . 50 ( paperback ) . reviewed by anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ loria . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book is a good introduction to the work which she has been doing during the past few years on both the representation of eventualities and temporal reasoning . the book combines her approach 's desire not to lose information previously given in discourse with semantic principles which are squarely based on situation semantics . this allows her to introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , which can loosely be described as temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points out that , though common sense reasoning plays an important role in temporal reasoning , it is not her aim to deal with it . finally the present paperback edition of the book incorporates an appendix giving some exercises on dat construction and a short account of the resemblance and difference between drt and dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims to account for the linguistic and informational balance between static and dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative to tense and aspect and using tools derived from situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes the world as being composed of two main types of temporal objects : events which introduce changes and states which do not . this linguistic capacity is accompanied by an inferential ability in interpretation of what is or is not the case when . ter meulen deals only with the simple past , the perfect , the progressive and some uses of the present , that is with tenses which indicate in which order events occur , through weak constraints on the temporal relations between events . the difference between the simple past and the perfect is aspectual , as is obvious when they are examined in the light of the difference between events and states : the simple past describes events in a context-dependent way while the perfect only gives stative information . aspect can be seen as imposing control on the flow of information and here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters and plugs which are closely related , respectively , to vendler 's classical ontological classes of activities ( "" john ran for half an hour "" ) , accomplishments ( "" john built a house "" ) and achievements ( "" john won the race "" ) . ter meulen introduces the notion of situated reasoning about time : according to her , there is a temporal vantage point in a text from which reasoning about the text can proceed . this is the first ( descriptive ) factor . the second ( aspectual ) factor is the source of information , while the third factor is perspective information . new temporal information is processed against a context ( the given ) which incorporates at least the lexicon and syntax of the language , situated and logical inference rules , other semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , the available information and the elements of the situation of use . 2 . the aspectual verbs the aspectual verbs describe the internal structure of events and are , in english , "" start "" , "" begin "" , "" commence "" , "" initiate "" , "" resume "" ( for event beginnings ) , "" continue "" , "" keep "" ( for event middles ) and "" end "" , "" finish "" , "" terminate "" , "" halt "" , "" cease "" , "" complete "" ( for event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing the middle or the end of an event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions about the previous existence not of an event , but of this event ) . aspectual verbs describing the onset of an event semantically have an indefinite and existential character . verbs describing the middle of an event are quantificational verbs and holes . verbs describing the ending of events may be filters or plugs depending on whether they can be finished ( plugs ) or ended ( holes ) . there are pairs of aspectual verbs linked by a semantic contrary relation , such as "" start / finish "" , "" stop / resume "" , "" resume / finish "" , "" keep / end "" , "" continue / end "" . in dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted of individuals , their relations and a positive or negative polarity . events can be classified in similarity classes or types based on their parts . a type consists in a relation , objects and a positive or negative polarity , indicating whether the relation holds or does not hold between the objects . types can also include parameters or indeterminate objects and can be used for any constituent apart from polarities . a given situation supports the type if it matches with its constituents . for types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends on the existence in the situation of some objects corresponding to the parameter and satisfying both the relation and the polarity . aspectual verbs can also be described in terms of their monotonicity : if inferences , for a given aspectual verbs , are valid from smaller parts to larger parts , the verb is monotone increasing , while if inferences are valid from larger parts to smaller parts , the verbs are monotone decreasing . ter meulen then proposes the aspectual cube , that is a cube allowing the representation of the relations between aspectual verbs as well as of their monotonicity properties . each vortex in the cube has two vertical arrows of which the first represents the dynamic plugs ( upward arrow ) / static holes ( downward arrow ) while the second represents the increasing ( upward arrow ) or decreasing ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . the cube visualizes the dynamic transitions beginning with + start ; and stopping with "" end "" or "" finish "" . its bottom corresponds to stative holes , while its top corresponds to dynamic plugs , allowing four combinations of arrows in english : dynamic plugs + increasing monotonicity , dynamic plugs + decreasing monotonicity , stative holes + increasing monotonicity , stative holes + descreasing monotonicity . external negation flips the left arrow changing the dynamicity , while internal negation flips the right arrow . finally , there is an arrow kinematics , whereby the combinations of arrow given above gives a dynamic or stative aspect , this being always determined by the right arrow ( i . e . the value of the combination is always the value of the right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) dats are a way of graphically representing information about events in directed graphs where nodes , labeled with descriptive information , can be either holes or plugs . each dat has a unique source node ( a plug ) , which is the rightmost terminal node , corresponding to the utterance event and determining the perspective . any information in the past tense has preceded the source and is represented by nodes on a branch to the left of it . present information include the source . thus left-to - right order represents the flow of time while downward arrows represent temporal inclusion . dats are used for temporal reasoning about the past ( though they do not allow modalities and counterfactuals ) . there is also in a dat a single root node , dominating all the other nodes , including the source , and representing the entire episode described . there is also a current node , which is the last constructed one and which can opened ( hole ) or closed ( plug ) , this property determining how the next information will be processed . if the current node is a plug , the new information will be represented as a new node descending from one of the current node 's parent nodes , usually the lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clauses introduce new nodes , while states , quantificational relations , perfect clauses with "" have "" and progressive clauses are introduced as stickers on the current node , if it is a plug , or on the next node , if it is a hole . stickers are portable and can be transmitted to new nodes when the dat grows . introducing a new node independent of the current one indicates a change in perspective . a path connecting a set of labeled nodes to the root is a chronoscope and the current chronoscope is the one containing the current node . compatibility relations ( which are symmetric , reflexive and transitive ) are determined both lexically and through the entailment relations between types on the same chronoscope . the notion of chronoscope is one of the main device of temporal reasoning in dats , allowing for persistence , i . e . the preservation of information . however , temporal reasoning depends on the current node , the search for a conclusion starting at the current node . dats are structured semantic objects rather than linguistic expressions and , as such they follow semantic rules . they are interpreted in event structures into which they are embedded and which allow temporal reasoning if they obey semantic constraints . interpretability for a text depends on the possibility of constructing a dat which can be embedded in an event structure obeying these constraints . an embedded dat describes an episode if the event structure in which it is embedded provides values for it . a text is true if the episode described in the dat is part of the world . 4 . states , generic information and constraints stative information are always represented as stickers on nodes in dats , but some states are more permanent than others , this difference being represented as portability conditions in perspective shifts . there are thus rules for downward portability conditions of stickers and for portability conditions for accommodation . portability conditions differ for perfect states and for progressive states . generic stative information is also represented by stickers and can be imported upward depending on whether the property is predicated under default to the members of a given category or on whether it is predicated of the category itself rather than of its members and on whether it appears in conditionals or under temporal quantification . 5 . perspectives a dat gives a certain perspective on the episode it describes and the same episode may be described in different dats , each giving a different perspective on it . this means that dats on the same episode can lead to different conclusions . changes of perspective depend on the rule used for the updating : hole or sticker rules do not change the perspective , plug or filler rules do . in other words , changes of chronoscope correspond to changes of perspective and depend on the status of the current node . there is , however , more to perspective than just creating a new chronoscope when updating the dat : the other possibility goes through perspective refinement . perspective refinement corresponds to the unplugging of a plug which turns it into a hole , allowing the addition of new information under it . the notion of perspective is strongly dependent on the compatibility of information or , more generally , on coherence and it is one of the merits of dat to allow for a more precise content to the rather slippery notion of coherence , relying on the rules for dat construction and the notion of chronoscope . perspective refinements usually correspond to flashbacks and consist of three operations : unplugging nodes in old chronoscopes , resetting the current node to an old one and making the existing nodes and the new nodes just added independent though they are dominated by the same ancestor . ter meulen proposes a tentative definition of such a flashback process . she notes that perspective allows perspective binding of np anaphora and proposes a perspective constraint to deal with it . finally ter meulen outlines the possibility of three-dimensional dats , the third dimension allowing for the representation of independent structures of nodes , though communality of the root is preserved . such three dimensional dats would be called scenarios though each part of such dats with a unique source would still describe an episode . parts of scenarios which incorporates different simultaneous episodes are scenes . 6 . a fragment of english in this chapter , ter meulen gives a syntactic and semantic account of a fragment of english , as "" a laboratory environment for the theory of interpretation "" ( 93 ) , as well as a recapitulation of the rules for dat construction and updating . 7 . epilogue dats allow for the simultaneous encoding of three types of information : aspectual control of information through the open / closed property of nodes , temporal part / whole relations between events , and descriptive information through the types labeling the nodes . dats are compatible with aristotelian realism as defined by barwise and perry , that is , with the view that the structure of information depends on the natural world . a distinction should be made , according to ter meulen between interpreting an utterance to extract the information it contains and evaluating the truth-value of that information . appendix in this appendix which has been added in the paperback edition , ter meulen has provided exercises on dat construction as well as a comparison between drt and dats . i will only comment on that second part of the appendix . as ter meulen notes , dats stems partly from drt . nevertheless and though dat logic is not developed enough to allow for a complete comparison , there are quite a few differences between them : dats account for inference from simple past to past perfect or progressive , for portability conditions of stative information in chronoscopes and for aspectual verbs , which drt does not ; drt accounts for temporal adverbials and for temporal interpretation of subordinate clauses , which dats do not ; dats substitute the notion of current chronoscope to the notion of temporal reference point used in drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference as depending crucially from the current node , while drt characterizes valid logic inference classically , as logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book is highly stimulating , original and interesting . it must be read by anyone interested in time , tense and aspect . all the criticisms which can be leveled against it come from one reason : the fact that the book is much too short . this means that though it is clear enough , it is rather difficult to read . it is also quite frustrating in that , for instance , though ter meulen does explain how to construct dats ( in chapter 3 ) and gives detailed rules , there is not enough step by step examples of dats in the book ( as for example , there was in kamp and reyle 1993 ) . in much the same way , one would have liked to have a much more detailed comparison with alternative accounts , such as drt , the parsonian account of events or , more generally , aktionsart . the appendix , which has been added in the paperback edition ( 1997 ) and which did not exist in the first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , is not really enough to satisfy both of these complaints . ter meulen 's book hints about a relation between reference to objects and reference to time ( the indefiniteness of the argument nps of a given verb may influence the interpretation of the clause , and , notably , aspect ) . all of these hints are very interesting and , again , a longer book might have given the author more scope to develop those intuitions . thus one can only hope that this interesting book will be followed by a bigger one , in which dat logic could be developed more fully , contrasted with alternative approaches and where ter meulen could describe more precisely her suggestions regarding perspective and the interaction between the semantic aspect in dats and the commonsense reasoning whose necessity she acknowledges but which she does not deal with in her book . finally , ter meulen 's book was published at the same time as pustejovsky 's work on the lexicon , thus she does n't make use of pustejovsky 's system . it would be nice to know if an intersection between these approaches can be made . references kamp , h . & reyle , u .

"that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers, vipul.

"summary : algonquian homeland content - length : 10189 in april i made an enquiry about the algonquian homeland of which a slightly abbreviated form is repeated below : * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i have just been reading merritt ruhlen 's _ the origin of language _ . i would like to ask a question or two about the content of the section ' locating the algonquian homeland ' . first , ruhlen says that ' frank siebert has proposed the area of the eastern upper great lakes as the origin of the algonquian dispersal ' . ruhlen does not source his reference . can anyone give me the source ? secondly , and more importantly , ruhlen appeals to sapir 's age - area hypothesis to the effect that the area of greatest diversity in a family is likely to point to the original homeland of the family . since the greatest divergence is evidently between blackfoot and the rest of the family , in the southwest of the family 's extent , ruhlen suggests , _ contra _ siebert , that the homeland is there , and that the family 's closest external relatives are also in that direction . as an initial attempt to locate a homeland , ruhlen 's arguments seem sound enough to an outsider . however , the kind of support for them that i would want to look for would be an argument that the first branching in the genealogical tree divides blackfoot from the rest of the family . this would be based on a claim that the rest of the family shares a set of innovations relative to proto algonquian ( a proto algonquian whose reconstruction also takes full account of blackfoot data ) . i went to the library here to see what i could find , and came up with ives goddard 's account of ' comparative algonquian ' in campbell & mithun 's _ the languages of native america _ ( 1979 ) . goddard says , if i read him correctly , ( i ) that the only obvious subgroup within algonquian is eastern algonquian ( and he gives innovations defining this ) , ( ii ) that blackfoot is highly divergent and that its history is not yet understood . goddard 's account understandably does not contain the kind of data that would allow a non - algonquianist to assess ruhlen 's hypothesis . i would be grateful to anyone who could point me towards any work that would cast light on the question of algonquian subgrouping and the homeland or who could comment knowledgably on ruhlen 's homeland hypothesis . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i would like to thank those who responded , some of them several times , and those who were generous enough to send me copies of materials i could not obtain here . they were : dan alford , peter bakker , david costa , pat crowe , marybeth culley , anthony fox , ives goddard , john koontz , phil lesourd , rob malouf , john o'meara , marc picard , karl teeter . i have n't had time yet to read the recommended references or to think carefully about the views expressed , which were varied . so varied , it seems to me , that when i set out to write a summary , i could n't , so i have resorted to extracting crucial passages from people 's messages . i hope this will not result in any misrepresentations . the siebert article is : siebert , frank . 1967 . the original home of the proto - algonquian people . a . d . deblois , contributions to anthropology : linguistics i ( algonquian ) , pp . 13-47 . national museum of canada , bulletin no . 214 , anthropological series no . 78 , ottawa several respondents drew my attention to the fact that the question of ' homeland ' is related to the question of time depth , i . e , how far back do we want to go in our search for the homeland ? one pointed out , however , that if algonquian is a subgroup of algic , then we can define the algonquian homeland as the area where proto algonquian ( a member of the algic subgroup ) was spoken , treating the algic homeland separately . ' best guess based on location ( of the algic homeland ) would be some sort of a northwest coast origin , but there is no real evidence for this . ' ' denny places the pa speakers around the upper columbia river in oregon and washington . he bases his conclusions on archaelogical evidence , the connections between pa and the larger algic language family , and on the existence of a handful of algonquian languages spoken along the northern coast of california . he proposes that the pa speakers radiated south to california and west to the great lakes ( giving us the precursors of blackfoot , cheyenne , and arapaho along the way ) . at least , i think that 's how it goes - you should really check the article . ' ' blackfoot and arapaho are the most divergent ( algonquian ) languages , and . . . thus the family probably started in the northern rockies and spread east from there . most algonquianists who think about such things these days recognize a lot of problems with siebert locating proto - algonquian in southern ontario . ives ' article ( goddard 1994 ) makes a lot of sense - - essentially the scenario is that the family came from idaho or thereabouts out onto the prairies in montana , and first dropped blackfoot . then , it continued east , dropping arapaho , cree , menominee - cheyenne , ' core central ' , and eastern algonquian . i ' m not too familiar with what archaeological support there is for this idea , but i do know there is no archaeological support for siebert 's idea ( southern ontario looks to be historically iroquoian ) . ' ' having read a number of studies by witold manczak that seem to show pretty convincingly that the more conservative languages in a family are in and around the original homeland , and the more divergent ones on the periphery , i find siebert 's hypothesis much more convincing , though i know there are legitimate algonkianists who would side with ruhlen on this . . . . i ' ve been working on algonkian for well over twenty years and i consider siebert to be one of the best algonkianists we ' ve ever had . ' ' for my own part , it seems to me probably relevant to the prehistory of algonquian that blackfoot , arapaho - atsina , and mandan ( siouan ) and hidatsa ( siouan ) are all associated with cultures that practiced rather similar age grouping systems ( similar society names , system otherwise not found in north america ) , and are located close together in the middle missouri archaeological area and points north . this region was fairly uniform culturally c . 2000 bp , and i wonder if the culture then most widespead in the area - besant - may not be the source of age grouping practice . it might also be associated with algonquian language ( s ) , though that would be impossible to prove . i think the siouan groups must have arrived somewhat later , during the development of the subsequent middle missouri tradition , but the cheyenne seem to have a middle missouri connection , and perhaps the algonquian affiliation with the middle missouri region is older . . . anyway , if besant was largely algonquian , then the existing plains algonquian groups ( not a linguistic subgroup ) , may reflect a formerly stronger algonquian presence on the northern plains . ' ' as for the position of blackfoot , i am myself of the opinion that its grammatical system is algonquian , but its lexicon is not . i know cree ( central algonquian ) reasonably well , but blackfoot remains completely unintelligible to me , although the language looks very algonquian ( unlike , for instance , gros ventre , arapaho and cheyenne - these algonquian languages are just as unintelligible , but this can be attributed to some recent ( few hundred years ago ) radical sound changes . . . . but few of these studies deal with the place of blackfoot in a comparative light . i think , simply because it is possible only to compare blackfoot and algonquian lexically . actually there are few blackfoot words ( stems ) which the algonquianists are able to link with algonquian . in my opinion . . . it is a mixed language , with a few algonquian stems , but the bulk from an unknown and otherwise extinct language families . the blackfoot stems sometimes look like algonquian backslang ( such as the word for 'd og ' ; blackfoot imita ( ua ) , plains cree atim ) . otherwise it is just impossible that the grammatical system is so close to cree whereas the lexicon is so different . but probably few hardcore algonquianists would agree . ' references i was given were : denny , j . peter , 1991 . the algonquian migration from plateau to midwest : linguistics and archeology , in the papers of the twenty - second algonquian conference , ed . william cowan . [ mentioned by several respondents ] dryer , matthew s . 1992 . a comparison of the obviation systems of kutenai and algonquian , in william cowan , ed . , papers of the twenty - third algonquian conference , pp . 119-163 . ottawa : carleton university . goddard , ives , 1994 . the east - west cline in algonquian dialectology , in actes du vingt - cinqui ' eme congr ' es des algonquinistes , ed . william cowan , pp . 187-211 . ottawa : carleton university .

"" the marketplace needs these things , but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them , "" parker said . "" i applaud what they are doing , but it is an uphill battle . "" enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal , a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers , shippers and service providers . the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight ' s 24 - hour customer service and operations center . this summer , enron took another step , by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper , but declined to identify it . dan reck , vice president of enron freight markets , said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others . "" what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market , "" reck said . a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery times , and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges , spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid , but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long - term contracts . "" what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes much more clean and predictable , "" reck said . "" so from a carrier ' s perspective , they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions . "" enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric - power markets , and is trying to change the way other markets , such as steel , are structured . efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation . "" we are kind of commodity - agnostic , "" reck explained . "" we don ' t care what the commodity is , we just sell capacity . "" enron ' s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte , the former national transportation exchange , puts buyers and sellers directly together , while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike the online services , enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website . under enron ' s ideal contract , damages for non - performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example , suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is 70 cents per mile , enron pays the difference . the same process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn ' t , enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference . reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers , carriers and other intermediaries . enron officials say they ' ve talked with 400 to 500 shippers since march . one goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a forum for negotiations , which the company believes would add legitimacy . in its first contract , enron is acting as a carrier , since the shipper already was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron considers itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves and leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk , for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees . enron is an extensive user of the internet , however , and last year launched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas , oil , electricity and various other commodities online . no one expects enron ' s new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry , and that enron is prepared for that .

Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 2."" 
 
> Because it never gets chance to reach a ""WriteMakefile"" line with a

I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway...

We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either.

The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA

"Gooday,With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
 En!
gland for 9years now. I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.Yours sincerely,
Donald Phiri.

"good day . . . . . . . . . . . . . dear friend , i am contacting you to front as a co - owner of my late husband ' s company and beneficiary of funds ( us $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) due the company . currently , i am a high ranking government official in the cabinet of the ruling president thabo mbeki ( south africa ) . i am a widow and mother of two children . my late husband mr ronald tshabalala died 1996 . after his death , i recently discovered that an over - invoiced proceeds of a contract i helped his company secure is yet to be paid out by the reserve bank of south africa . presently the funds can also be paid out by south africa ' s offshore bank in england . like i stated earlier on , this funds emanated as a result of an over - invoiced contract which my husband ' s company executed with the government of south africa . i am afraid that the government of south africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1995 to date . if they discover this money yet unclaimed with my husband ' s name linked to it , the government will confiscate the money and seize his assets here in south africa and this will definitely affect my political career in government . i want your assistance to front as a co - owner of his company ( tshabalala construction , ltd ) to facilitate the release of the funds . i will introduce a very good attorney to assist us with the transfer process without any hitch but he will not be told my interest in the transaction as i play a very sensitive role in my government . as the contract was executed in my present government department , be rest assured that i will use my position to approve the immediate release of the entitlement . as soon as the funds are release in your favour , you are expected to move it immediately into your personal bank account in your country . please once you have confirmed receipt of the funds into your account , i want you to notify me immidiately , so that i will arrange to meet with you . the lawyer i will recommend to assist us will be representing our interest at the reserve bank of south africa and all necessary quarters . all future correspondence must be made either to the attorney or myself . please , i want you to note here that i am reposing huge trust on you regardless of your being a total stranger ; please , lets make brotherhood and sincerity our watchword . upon your reply , we shall discuss your percentage for your assistance . if you agree to my proposal , please endeavour to send me an urgent reply through my email address or this my private email address ssigo @ netscape . net again note that due to my sensitive position as serving government official , i will only give you more details of myself when we proceed further and this is after i have confirmed your sincerity towards this transaction . i would not want you to phone or fax me for now . thank you . stella sigcau honesty and transparency , they are my best work tools ."
"could of i have been following the recent discussion of ` would of ' with interest , as i am writing my dissertation on the grammaticalization of ` wouldve ' / ` couldve ' / ` shouldve ' ( i . e . modal + ` have ' + pastparticiple constructions ) . [ for those unfamiliar with the term , grammaticalization is , approximately , a type of gradual reanalysis that turns material that used to be more independent and lexical into material that is more dependent and grammatical . ] i ' ve noticed that the discussion has focused on pronunciation and spelling as indicators of "" native speaker intuitions . "" another approach is to look at syntax . many speakers consider what wouldve you done ? pretty close to acceptable ( though of course many other speakers completely reject this ) . then there are also sentences like ( both heard on npr in the past week ) they never asked the right questions when they shouldve have . ( orangecounty ) or if this incident had occurred a year ago , i wouldve had been more concerned about it . ( helicopter in n . korea ) for now i will make a couple of points of my own , and next time i will respond to some previous postings , esp . frits stuurman 's queries . 1 ) syntactic data like these can tell us what speakers feel belong together . is the / @ v / a verb ? a preposition ? this data does n't answer those questions , but does tell us that ` wouldve ' is being interpreted as a unit that behaves like an auxiliary verb . 2 ) intuition data can be supplemented with corpus data and experimental data . for instance , in pilot elicited imitation experiments where subjects try to repeat exactly what the stimulus tape says , i am finding that modal + adverb + have sequences are much more often repeated as modal + have + adv , than modal + have + adv sequences are repeated as modal + adverb + have . this is another way to show that ` have ' ( often pronounced / @ v / or / @ / ) is , for some speakers , dependent on the modal . as for corpus research , i have diachronic data suggesting a historical trend in this direction . i am also working on comparing synchronic spoken vs . written data . 3 ) as part of my dissertation , i ' ve been planning to get "" expansions "" of contracted forms , like what tom cravens described , and i am getting subjects from age 4 on up to as old as i can find . so hopefully in a few months i ' ll have some systematic data to answer some of the questions that people have raised . by the way : does anyone have a good name for this type of construction ? the best i ' ve been able to come up with so far is "" past counterfactual "" , but i 'd prefer a name with a more syntactic , less semantic , sense . joyce tang boyland ( jtang @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) institute of cognitive studies , uc berkeley"

than 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer 
logs millisecond by millisecond.Google is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.So what is the world thinking about?Sex, for one thing.``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking 
at the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. 
(To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, 
though less successfully with foreign languages.)Despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much 
of its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble 
to the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what 
they are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of 
Google's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and 
protecting the data record.Google's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has 
given Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has 
been able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including 
milzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell 
which countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and 
Germany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the 
globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are 
far-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.Judging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost 
everywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race 
and the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last 
year. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music 
and celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a 
Google engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney 
Spears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her 
popularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of 
the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.Glancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural 
literacy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and 
girlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list 
recently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose 
members was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and 
fentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages 
taken by Chechen rebels in late October).The long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney 
Spears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them 
understand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she 
broke up with Justin Timberlake.Google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more 
serious nature, immediately.On Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 
am local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to 
250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific 
Northwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and 
CNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, 
Nostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that 
Nostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.But the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive 
cultural seismic meter.The logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden 
name'' had surged to the top of the charts.Curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they 
were neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes 
after the hour.As the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. 
Why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s 
sitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not 
explain them.That is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena 
per se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a 
member of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what 
else is going on in the world.''So what had gone on on April 22, 2001?That night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be 
a Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds 
after the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to 
search for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was 
broadcast successively in each US time zone.The precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some.``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said 
Sergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford 
helped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. 
``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.''Predictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and 
radio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. 
One of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends 
before they hit the radar of other media.As such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or 
retailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for 
commercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is 
tremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The 
challenge is defining what we want to do.''Google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data 
because of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, 
originating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to 
a specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People 
tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly 
_ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the 
aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual.In aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next 
to Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a 
three-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being 
used around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots 
shooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey 
the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest 
flames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area.Each country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy 
have a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely 
lunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when 
phone rates for dial-up modems drop.Google's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and 
phenomena as they hop from country to country.Take Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in 
Spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking 
dance similar to the Macarena.Like a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated 
through Europe over the summer and fall.The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 
countries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches 
began a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the 
Netherlands.Haven't heard of Las Ketchup?If you haven't, Google predicts you soon will.

"industry giants can ' t match this opportunity another ground breaking news alert from rlyc . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come . although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year . an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments . the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally . just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company . below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years . rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force ! rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards . but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem . rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms . rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations . the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers . this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues . $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances . the problems with traditional money transfer methods with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use . with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets . what is the best way to send remittances ? by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country . the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler . rlyc has already begun filling orders in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months . rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition . rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! ! rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry . rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty . rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre -

Vipul Ved Prakash said:> Are there any suggestions for ""fixing"" this in razor-agents? razor-agents

Razor and handled gracefully (logging to syslog or /dev/null), it'd be a
great help.As it stands, if the log file is unwritable, the razor check falls over
entirely as the constructor returns undef (unblessed reference = 'die'
error in perl).--j.

Date: Not supplied[IMG: http://www.konaweb.com/stick/left.jpg] I often carry my ukulele with me 
on planes. The case is so little it can fit in my suit case. I missed a great 
photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's 
a stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still 
need to carry around an amp, though. Link[1] Discuss[2] _(Thanks, Prentiss[3]!)

Date: Not suppliedTeresa's written a wonderful blog post about the revelation that Tyco's crooked 
CEO spent ""6,000 on a shower curtain, $15,000 for an umbrella stand, $2,900 on 
coat hangers, $5,960 on bedsheets and $2,200 for a wastebasket.""     Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for 
    your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do 
    so, practically essential. Then they explain how:     ""Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed,"" said Joel Joves, a designer with 
    offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. ""If you have a fabulous study 
    or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with 
    decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a 
    room.""     That's Fool Money at work. If you can't find a sufficiently fabulous 
    wastebasket for $200, $500 absolute tops, you're not half trying.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/2002_10.html#001484

If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.Matthias--

COCKLES OF ONE'S HEART  You may recall that I was a bit suspicious
of the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed
out that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,
the ventricles of the heart were at times called ""cochleae cordis"",
where the second word is derived from ""cor"", heart. Those unversed
in Latin could have misinterpreted ""cochleae"" as ""cockles"". Oddly,
""cochlea"" in Latin means ""snail"" (from the shape of the ventricles
- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if
this story is right we should really be speaking of warming the
snails of one's heart.SERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd
expression that I tried to make sense of last week. Taken together,
they show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it
was originally something like ""My sufficiency has been suffonsified
and anything additional would be superfluous"". That form of the
word is the one that is most common in online searches, where the
Canadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears
in a passage in Margaret Atwood's novel, ""Cat's Eye"": she has two
teenage girls living in Toronto in the 1940s who say, ""Are you
sufficiently sophonisified?"". A Vancouver restaurant reviewer has
the pen name ""Sufficiently Suffonsified"". Oddly, there's also a
1999 record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled ""Paradigms
Suffonsified"". G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the word might be
a punning blend of ""sufficient"" and ""fancified"". There are some
tantalising suggestions that it may actually be Scots, and not New
World at all.ABSQUATULATE  I have been gently remonstrated with for describing
""sockdologer"" as one of the products of early American linguistic
inventiveness that hasn't survived to the present day. Many people
gave me examples of current or recent use. I stand corrected.
2. Turns of Phrase: Thinspiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the key words associated with a deeply disquieting
online trend. In the past couple of years or so a number of Web
sites and chatrooms have appeared which actively promote anorexia
nervosa (known on the sites as ""ana"") and other eating disorders as
lifestyle choices. Since 90% of anorexics are young women, these
""pro-ana"" sites are usually run by and attract that group (one term
sometimes used for them is ""weborexics""). Sites offer suggestions
on how to become and remain thin, often through tips on avoiding
eating, and how to disguise the condition from family and friends.
Other themes sometimes featured on such sites are self-mutilation
(""cutting"") and bulimia (""mia""). Thin women, such as supermodels
and Calista Flockhart, are presented as ""thinspirations"", examples
to emulate. Sites have had names such as Starving for Perfection,
Wasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin. Medical professionals
in the US and UK are deeply concerned about them, because they
accentuate the low self-regard of young women, who are particularly
prone to eating disorders, put their lives at risk, and discourage
them from facing their illness and seeking treatment for it.The Internet is home to a number of pro-eating disorder Web sites -
- places where sufferers can discuss tips, trade low-calorie
recipes and exchange poems and art that may be used as ""triggers""
or so-called ""thinspiration.""
                                         [""Calgary Sun"", Feb. 2002]A new trend among young adults has been sweeping the nation: pro-
anorexia Web sites. Also known as pro-ana, these sites glorify
anorexia nervosa and offer ""thinspiration"" on maintaining a
starvation lifestyle.

3. Weird Words: Usufructuary  /ju:zjU'frVktju:@rI/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A person who has the use or enjoyment of something, especially
property.We are short of words that contain four u's. Among the few that are
even relatively common (leaving aside the Hawaiian ""muu-muu"") are
""tumultuously"" and ""unscrupulous"", although some rare words like
""pustulocrustaceous"" and ""pseudotuberculous"" are also recorded.The term comes from Roman law. ""Usufruct"" is the right of temporary
possession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else,
so far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its
substance. For example, a slave in classical Rome could not own
anything. Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely
held ""usus (et) fructus"", under ""use (and) enjoyment"" - it was his
master who actually owned them.The term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere.
These days a ""usufructuary"" can be a trustee who enjoys the income
from property he holds in trust for somebody else. Many Native
American groups hold land on a ""usufruct"" basis, with rights to
enjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and
fishing.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How does the term ""three sheets to the wind"" denote drunkenness?
[Benjamin Weatherston]A. It's a sailor's expression.We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but in
traditional sailing-ship days, a ""sheet"" was actually a rope,
particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes
from an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were
vital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,
the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow
off its course out of control.Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the
ship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular
and uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded
onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose.
Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image
across, so the saying became ""three sheets to the wind"".Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life,
Pierce Egan, in his ""Real life in London"" of 1821. But it must
surely be much older.                        -----------Q. My East End mother-in-law used to say she was ""well and truly
mogadored"" when she was puzzled by something. Any idea of
derivation and meaning? [Bryan]A. Now that's a bit of British slang I haven't heard in years,
though it is still around (Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry
Pratchett's Discworld fantasy stories, I am told). As you say, it
means that somebody is puzzled, confused, or ""all at sea"". It's
also sometimes spelled ""moggadored"", though it doesn't turn up in
print much in either spelling. (No relation to the British word
""moggy"" for a cat, by the way, which seems to be a pet form of
""Margaret"".)The writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its
origin. It looks very much like rhyming slang for ""floored"", which
is likewise slang, meaning dumbfounded or confused. But the dispute
arises over what the root is. Some say it is Irish, from ""magagh"",
to mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecorded intermediate form
""mogadÃ³i"".Others suggest that, like some other East End slang terms, it
derives from the Gypsy language Romany (Cockney slang is like
London itself, a melting pot, in which words from many sources are
amalgamated, including Yiddish and old-time forces slang derived
from languages around the world). In this case the source may be
""mokardi"" or ""mokodo"", something tainted (these Romany words also
provide the root for yet another slang phrase, ""to put the mockers
on something"", to jinx it).Sorry not to be able to be more definite!                        -----------Q. I was having an interesting discussion with an American
professor of business studies who also consults to industry. She
was recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software
corporate, which the UK managing director described as a ""skunk
project"". I have seen this epithet before, usually in the phrase
""skunk works"", meaning a semi-official project team that is tacitly
licensed to bend the rules and think outside the box. I wonder what
the derivation is? I don't think it can refer to the smelly wild
animal, but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a
strong variant of marijuana. Can you shed any light? [Martin
Hayman]A. We must start in Dogpatch, the fictional place in the backwoods
of upper New York State made famous between 1934 and 1977 as the
home of professional mattress tester Li'l Abner, in the comic strip
written and drawn by Al Capp. The original was actually ""Skonk
Works"", the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed
their highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients
such as old shoes and dead skunks. (""Skonk"" is a dialect variant of
""skunk"".)We must now move to the very real Burbank, California. In 1943, a
small group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation (headed by Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson) were
given the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch,
the P-80 ""Shooting Star"" jet fighter. This they did in 143 days, 37
days ahead of schedule. Their secret project was housed in a
temporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent, which had
been thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory. The story goes
that one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day
with the phrase ""Skonk Works here"" and the name stuck. It is also
said that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was
changed to Skunk Works.One division of the company, formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced
Development Program, is still known as the Skunk Works. The term
has been trademarked by Lockheed Martin, who have been aggressive
in protecting it.As a generic term, it dates from the 1960s. One definition is very
much that of the original and the one you describe: a small group
of experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company's operations
in order to develop some experimental technology or new application
in secrecy or at speed, unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict
application of regulations (Kelly Johnson formulated 14 visionary
rules for running such an operation, which are still regarded as
valid even now). It is also sometimes used for a similar group that
operates semi-illicitly, without top-level official knowledge or
support, though usually with the tacit approval of immediate
management.

"acl-99 call for theme proposals call for theme proposals acl-99 conference : the 37th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics university of maryland june 22 - - 27 1999 the association for computational linguistics would like to encourage the submission of papers on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics . a particular aim for the 1999 conference is a broadening of both the thematic coverage and geographical origin of submissions ; to this end , we are experimenting with a new format . some proportion of the conference will be given over to special sessions , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organised around themes proposed by members of the nlp community . our aim is to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshops , without replacing those workshops - - - we expect , as has become traditional , that there will also be a set of post-conference workshops that will remain separate from the main meeting . this call invites proposals for thematic sessions in accordance with the considerations below ; a final call for papers will be sent out in early november . what is a thematic session ? we are soliciting proposals for themes that will provide 4 - - 8 high quality papers , typically forming one or two sessions in the main conference . proposers of accepted themes , who will become the chairs of those sessions , will have similar responsibilities to those of workshop organisers in terms of arranging reviewing and the delivery of camera ready copy ; however , the papers will be scheduled as part of the main sessions and will be published as part of the main conference proceedings . in terms of subject area coverage , we expect thematic sessions will be closer to workshop topic areas in focus . format of theme proposals please specify the following : - chair details : name , address , email , telephone number , fax - title - summary : at most one page describing the proposed subject area , citing evidence that there is sufficient interest in the area to generate enough high quality submissions to populate up to a half-day 's worth of presentations . - proposed review committee : each paper submitted should be reviewed by at least three people . as part of your proposal , you should suggest a potential review committee of around 12 people who will be asked to serve on the committee if the proposal is accepted . your list should demonstrate the spread of interest in the area in the community , encouraging both international participation and the participation of a broad range of researchers , including both senior members of the community and graduate students . theme proposals should be submitted to the email address provided below . informal enquiries as to what might work as a theme can also be directed to this address in advance of the submission date . possible themes might be topics like : nlp and data mining ; word segmentation in asian languages ; reconciling functional and formal approaches to syntax ; approaches to concept to speech . we provide these examples only as indications of the variety of topic areas that will be considered . important dates this call issued : september 14 , 1998 theme submissions deadline : october 12 , 1998 notification of selected themes : october 26 , 1998 call for papers : early november 1998 paper submissions deadline : january 25 , 1999 notification of acceptance : march 22 , 1999 camera ready papers due : may 3 , 1999 general submission questions chairs for the acl-99 program are ken church and robert dale . all queries regarding the program should be sent to acl99 @ mri . mq . edu . au ; this forwards to both authors . submission format theme proposals should be of approximately two pages in length , ideally submitted in ascii by email to acl99 @ mri . mq . edu . au with the subject : "" acl99 theme proposal "" . more complicated formats such as standalone latex ( not requiring additional style files ) , postscript , and word will be accepted if they print on the first try . hardcopy proposals should be faxed or mailed to * both * of the chairs , clearly labeled "" acl99 theme proposal "" . proposals should be received by 5pm gmt on october 12th 1998 . ken church ( co - chair ) robert dale ( chair ) at&t labs - research microsoft research institute 180 park ave , office d235 school of mpce po box 971 macquarie university florham park , nj 07932-0971 , usa sydney nsw 2109 , australia kwc @ research . att . com robert . dale @ mq . edu . au tel : + 1 973-360 - 8620 tel : + 61 2 9850 6331 fax : + 1 973-360 - 8077 fax : + 61 2 9850 9529"

"re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites several people submitted "" overlook "" and "" oversight "" , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's "" outgoing : retiring "" is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of "" oversight "" and "" overlook "" stems largely from their compounding with "" over - "" . "" over "" is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , "" over "" can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in "" get over it "" and "" skip over "" . so my analysis of "" oversight "" and "" overlook "" would be that in one sense , "" over "" takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the "" sight / see / look "" part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as "" see to it "" "" look to your own interest "" seem to carry some of this "" authority "" meaning . i think the "" over "" analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them ."

"alliance info alert dear generation / power marketing executive : the following is this week ' s alliance express newsletter , and a special announcement regarding a proposed action by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) . fasb 133 fasb is considering an exception to statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no . 133 that will exempt energy companies from the requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives . a vote against the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility , and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers . ( attached is a summary of this issue . ) the board is expected to vote on this issue during may 2001 . eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns . if you , or company cfo would like more information about this effort , please contact richard mcmahon , executive director of the alliance of energy suppliers , at rmcmahon @ eei . org , or at 202 - 508 - 5571 . alliance of energy suppliers express   april 25 , 2001 inside washington federal affairs * * * bill repealing puhca is approved by senate committee * * * the senate banking committee today approved s 206 , a bill that repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935 . the bill would repeal puhca and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and appropriate state agencies . s . 206 was approved with two amendments . offered by sen . mike enzi ( r - wy ) , the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the united states . the task force would be made up of representatives of ferc , the department of justice and the federal trade commission , as well as non - voting representatives from the department of agriculture and the securities and exchange commission . the amendment also contained a provision , co - sponsored by sen . paul sarbanes ( d - md ) , that would preserve ferc ' s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass - through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy . another amendment , offered by sen . jon corzine ( d - nj ) , initiated a study by the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets . * * * institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill * * * the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association ( appa ) and the large public power council ( lppc ) again has been introduced in the house . the bill ( hr 1459 ) contains the same provisions as were in a measure ( hr 4971 ) , with technical corrections , introduced during the 106 th congress . hr 1459 was introduced by rep . j . d . hayworth ( r - az ) and nine original co - sponsors from the ways and means committee . hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes : 1 ) the tax - free sale or spin - off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed , 2 ) nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost - of service ratemaking , 3 ) the contributions in aid of construction ( ciac ) tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated , and 4 ) private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities . the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee , and eei has urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward . enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment , the institute noted . the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389 , senate energy committee chairman frank murkowski ' s ( r - ak ) energy security bill , and stand - alone legislation could also be introduced . hearings are expected to be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees , probably after consideration of president bush ' s individual tax proposal . administration / ferc * * * white house seeks $ 2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002 * * * president bush last week transmitted a $ 2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to capitol hill . the administration noted that its proposal * moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002 , * an increase of $ 26 billion over the preceding fiscal year . the budget bid contains a $ 231 billion total surplus in 2002 , and projects a $ 5 . 6 trillion surplus over the next ten years . in the energy area , the administration noted the federal government   s * longstanding and evolving role * in the sector , pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts . it proposed about $ 2 . 8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs , and about $ 2 . 1 billion in tax benefits , * mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources . * doe   s budget request was $ 19 . 2 billion , including $ 2 . 3 billion for energy resources programs . this later figure represents a decrease of $ 196 million , or 7 . 9 percent , from fiscal year 2001 . in the environmental sector , the administration sought some $ 7 . 3 billion in discretionary funding for epa , including a $ 3 . 7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws . * * * success of restructuring tied to energy strategy , ferc   s massey asserts * * * electric restructuring may be in jeopardy , and its success * is in the hands of regulators and policymakers , * ferc commissioner william massey has asserted . speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum in philadelphia , commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy . first , he specified , there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity . turning to a second element , commissioner massey told forum attendees that * all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate , efficient , non - discriminatory network . * commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy , while citing an inherent difficulty : that * good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions . * accordingly , he said , ferc and the states must work together on market structure . the final element of a successful energy strategy , the commissioner specified , is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to do their job . * if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers , * he cautioned , they * will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path . * new generation * * * dynegy to build second plant in kentucky * * * dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to the riverside generating project in lawrence county , kentucky . dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market . commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002 . * * * ppl to expand generation capacity * * * ppl corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near chicago and would increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 megawatts . ceo william hecht said the illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of 2002 . * * * constellation energy group announces eight new plants * * * constellation energy group this week announced that the company is scheduled to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer . additionally , four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers . the four peaking plants are located in illinois , pennsylvania , virginia and west virginia . the larger power plants are under construction in california , florida , illinois , and texas . * we   re building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business , * said constellation energy group chairman and ceo christian poindexter . * * * california energy commission approves construction of otay mesa generating plant * * * pg & e corporation   s national energy group ( neg ) last week announced that the california energy commission ( cec ) has approved construction of the otay mesa generating plant in san diego county , which the neg has developed . the 500 megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1 , 000 homes . after the development process is completed , calpine corporation will assume ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant . neg will contract for up to half the plants output . energy data * * * weekly electric output ( week 15 ) * * * electric output reached 63 , 528 gwh for the week ending april 14 ( week 15 ) , with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the south central states , which both had a 12 . 6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15 . year -

"sum : 501 - beaver revisited - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - on july 8 i posted the following two sentences , 1 . the beaver got a christmas card because she did n't notice the brown paper bag at her back door . 2 . one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . in order to find out their ( hidden ) meaning . these sentences were part of a set of isolated idiomatic sentences , without any given context whatsoever , which my wife and i were trying to translate . the meaning of the majority of these sentences could be found rather easily by means of the usual resources , like common sense , ( slang - ) dictionaries and encyclopedia 's . however , 501 - beaver remained a mystery . so we decided to consult internet , to see if a native speaker could help us out . about 50 reactions came from all over the world ! with your help the 501 mystery has been solved . thanks a lot ! however , unfortunately ' the beaver has not landed ' . sorry to have bothered you with this weird sentence . we simply expected this sentence to be a common idiomatic expression . . . most of you mentioned the sexual connotations of ' beaver ' , ' bag ' and ' back door ' . the ' christmas card ' , however , does not fit into this picture . it might be a reference to something unpleasant , but then the sentence as a whole still remains highly cryptic ; the parts just do n't match ! some of you came up with the possibility , that ' the brown paper bag ' might refer to ( hiding ) a bottle of liquor . in this context ' to get a christmas card ' might be a euphemism for a hang-over or an alcohol problem . but still the sentence as a whole does not make much sense . . . another possible solution might be found in cockney rhyming slang , in which ' christmas card ' refers to ' guard ' , but then again : the other parts of the sentence just refuse to cooperate . . . or maybe the sentence refers to a childrens book or a fairy tale ? fortunately the ' 501 deal ' was more common and so it was a lot easier to figure out the meaning of the second sentence . a few people thought the 501 might be a car . this possibility had crossed our minds too . after having looked it up in a car encycopedia and having consulted a local peugeot dealer , indeed a 301 , a 401 , and a 601 , and even a 504 , turned out to exist ; a peugeot 501 , however , just does n o t exist ! so this solution had to be ruled out . the great majority of the respondents told us , that 501 refers to the popular button-fly levi 's blue jeans with straight legs . in holland this type of jeans is familiar also , but we did n't understand the "" major used - 501 deal "" in this context : "" what 's the big deal in selling worn blue jeans ? "" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 's in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more ' hip ' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 's and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there 's a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 's out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 's , as rumour has it that used 501 's are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 's , what 's it all about "" 501 's are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 's are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi 's . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 's are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you ' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like "" cash for used 501 's . "" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi 's were the prestige brand ; i do n't know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . "" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal "" used 501 's are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans ' "" . witnessing a 501 deal "" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 's , with 'd eal ' meaning ' ( business ) transaction ' , or 'd eal ' could mean ' bargain ' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb ' witness ' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . "" . cowboys like their 501 's blue and stiff "" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n't wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) "" . a used - 501 deal "" i ' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for "" used 501s . "" "" 501 "" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i ' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i ' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i 'd say that a "" major used - 501 deal "" is either a transaction such as the one i ' m proposing for tomorrow or , because "" deal "" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like "" thing "" , a place of business where such transactions take place . "" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction "" "" a major used - 501 deal "" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . "" deal "" is so inarticulate a word that it 's not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to "" getting a good deal "" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n't have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( "" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business "" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone 's having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for "" a major used - 501 deal "" . 1 . "" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans "" 2 . "" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand "" 3 . "" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans "" "" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition ' to witness ' - - at least when it means ' to see sth . ' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the ' 501 deal ' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . "" can best be paraphrased into : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi 's 501 .

is that they were going on phenotypes,
and didn't engineer the genetics.  That
example makes a good case for natural
selection, but not for artificial.(do ""married people live longer"" because
of the benefits of matrimony, or because
acceptable health is one of the qualities
selected for in spouses?)Of course, if there are FoRKs with six
or fewer biological great grandparents
(or who are offspring of Wilt) I should
eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro
distinction seems much more relevant.-Dave> I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing

for checks: livestock owners have, over a
period of millenia, altered the genetics
of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
more tolerant of industrial living, so if
caution is in order, they are some of the
least likely people to volunteer it.

any are going to give you problems with a specific distribution/version.
With Dell just check the support.dell.com site, match the system, look for
downloadable drivers. From these if there aren't any linux drivers you can
usually find out the chipset of each device. Plug them into google with
""linux"" and see what people have to say about them. Generally speaking when
you buy the system you'll be told the make/model of each device rather than
the chipset, so further investigation is necessary.	The cavaet, of course, is always to know exactly what you're buying.
In most people's cases unfortunately it's not the person who bought the
systems that will be configuring them.steve

edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
computers to work for example).HTH,

I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting,
both pratically and asymptotically.It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)),
or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation.  Before the best methods took
O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it.
The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes
time O(n^(3+eps)).  Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding
some logarithmic factors.After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the
number of points on the curve.Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using
a 1 GHz Pentium III:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"date formats hello , this is a query about the different ways in which dates can be expressed in different languages , and whether there are constraints that apply in relation to register ( eg formal , informal , etc ) , genre ( magazine , newspaper , personal vs business letter , etc ) , historical , instrumental ( format of calendars ) , nationality , etc . my initial impressions are the following . as far the english speaking world goes , in britain there is a variety of ways in which dates can be expressed in writing , including day month year ; day-ordinal month year ; month day , year ; month day-ordinal , year . interestingly , this variety is not found in numerical form , in which ` day / month / year ' is expected . note that the separators vary , the most common being the slash ( / ) , others being the dash ( - ) , the period ( . ) and the blank space ( ) . in the other formats in which words are used , only the ` month ' slot can be spelled out , with days and years being expressed in numbers . variations include the use of ` the ' preceding ordinal day numbers . sometimes one can find different formats being used in different parts of the same publication , eg the header and the report in a newspaper . this seems to be in contrast with the usa where ` month day , year ' seems to predominate whatever the situation , even when expressed numerically as in 1 / 7 / 95 which is normally read by americans as the seventh day of the month of january , whereas the british would take it to mean the first day of the month of july , which is a 6 - month difference . apparently , the americans are the only ones to adopt month / day / year . someone once told me this is an old format which came into being as a result of the fact that , in looking for today 's date , one would look in a calendar first of all for the current month , with the year being taken for granted . any ideas ? what 's the norm in other languages / dialects , etc ? thanks in advance , tony - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tony berber sardinha | tony1 @ liverpool . ac . uk aelsu | fax 44-51 - 794-2739 university of liverpool | po box 147 | http : / / www . liv . ac . uk / liverpool l69 3bx | ~ tony1 / homepage . html uk | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"

BTW:  I remember messing about with such things long ago.  One 
problem I ran into was making sure that no attempt was made to 
play a sound when either:a)  the screen was locked
  or
b)  no exmh was running.Just something to think about, Dag.

"I have a situation with a small network as follows:A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
VMware access local linux disks.An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
access to its filesystems.How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze
98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS
server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities
down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.
which I presume is what I will need to have running here.I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords
between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual
intervention.Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully
received.

updates for april here is the updated version
"re : 5 . 1196 corpus analysis of - body / - one in my dissertation ( 1993 : a theoretical and descriptive study of epicene pronouns ) i analyzed a corpus of 24 us tv talkshows . i got 16 examples of nps with "" every "" coreferent with a pronoun . the distribution of the nominal element can be found below : 10 - body 3 - one 3 lexical nominal ( s ) the lexical nominals were "" member , "" "" grand jury and trial witness , "" and "" sales person in the store . "" in addition one of the cases with - body was "" everybody involved "" and another was "" everybody else . "" so far this seems to be along the lines discussed by ellen prince and jane edwards . where my data varies is that in every case the coreferent pronoun was they , as was incidently the case with each and no . as far as the analysis is concerned , my results , not just from quantifiers but from nps with other specifiers , indicated that there are various factors at work in the selection of the pronoun , as indeed edwards argues . the following seemed important : notional plurality : obviously the case with every , no , and each . in some cases a singular pronoun is impossible when there is plural semantics and formal singularity , as is well known from studies of quantifier scope . even however when it is structurally possible , the use of singular pronoun can be awkward as prince intuited , though i suspect more than just the nominal element of the compound is involved . in any case , in two out of the three everyone cases was clearly outside the scope , so the plural pronoun was inevitable . in the third case it was in a parenthetical ( from donahue ) and i ' m not sure of the fine points regarding the formal semantics : "" since i do n't know how everyone develops , what their sexual attraction is , you could easily have been into infantilism , or purple handkerchiefs , or same sex experiences "" gender stereotypes : this issue did n't arise with every cases , since all were with they , but in others i found that stereotypically male generic referents ( e . g participant in congressional sex scandals , and lumberjacks ) more frequently received the pronoun he with other types of antecedents . individuation : this is a rather fuzzy , but i think inevitable , semantic category that refers to the degree with which interlocutors are using a referent as an individual versus how that referent is being used as a generic . the fuzziness is necessary because logical real existence does not map into our everyday reference . a personification ( discussed with regards to pronouns by mcconnell - ginet ) is a generic referent treated as if it were an individual . the opposite case , a real person or thing treated as a generic also exists and is discussed with regard to definiteness by talmy givon . i found a couple of cases like this . from a geraldo , the reference is to princess grace : "" how do you fall in love with somebody at a photo opportunity , not see them for eight months and the next time you see them you ' re engaged . "" from a different geraldo : "" i heard , - saw someone run by and they were screaming . "" individuation is clearly the same thing that jane edwards noticed in her point about how singular pronouns are associated with specific people . and similar point was also made by pinker in the language instinct in the chapter on prescription . i found the best analysis of the whole issue can be made by adopting the agreement theory developed by michael barlow in his ' 88 dissertation a situated theory of agreement published last year in the outstanding dissertations series . anybody else have any data ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu"

 | Read Full Story Scripting flaw threatens Web serversA flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the Internet, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

CollabNet will host the Butterfly Lab, an online environment that will allow developers to test games using a service modeled on the Butterfly approach.

Russian firm points out new Adobe flawThumbing its nose at the company that landed one of its employees in jail, ElcomSoft is pointing out new flaws in Adobe Systems' eBook software.
The flaws could allow someone to check out every copy of every book in Adobe's new electronic library for an unlimited amount of time by changing the values in the loan form. However, the bugs were discovered on an Adobe test Web site that demonstrates how the software could be used to set up a lending library--not an actual site that offers books--and ElcomSoft gives information about how to fix the flaws.

The project was carried out by scientists from the U.K.'s E-Science Centres and was co-funded by IBM and Oracle. The companies, rival powers in the database market, contributed both funding and the efforts of their own researchers.

""" sycophant "" , more . subsequent to my recent posting about the origin of the word "" sycophant "" i received two comments which add interesting insights . i am forwarding them for your information . richard blucher > from dave wharton ( whartond @ iris . uncg . edu ) liddel & scott 's _ greek - english lexicon _ shows the word sykophanths in common usage not before the middle of the 5th century b . c . no ancient uses show any relation of the word to the "" sign of the fig . "" here 's the political context of its use in the 5th century and later , from the oxford classical dictionary : "" athens had no public prosecutors in the modern sense . solon permitted citizens to prosecute any wrongdoers . inducements were offered to volunteers in certain cases by granting them a liberal share of fines and moneys recovered from the treasury . the system worked : there was no lack of prosecutors . but c . 450 b . c . abuses appeared . men began to make a profession of prosecutions for personal , political , and financial reasons . these were called sycophants . in spite of constant references by aristophanes and the orators , there survives no legal definition of a sycophant . . . . the most dangerous type of sycophant was the blackmailer who extorted money so that the guilty escaped punishment and the innocent paid blackmail . . . "" * * * * * > from zqv6656 @ acfcluster . nyu . edu a belated comment on your query on "" the sign of the fig "" . in my homeland , i . e . istria which an adriatic peninsula in the northwestern part of croatia ( former yugoslavia ) we use this sign in two ( related ? ) meanings . the first one is the one mentioned by many other people who responded to you , i . e . the sign of defiance and strong rejection . it does not have any sexual or indecent connotation . its second use is as a good luck sing ( much as crossed fingers in america ) , but then it is done on both hands for either yourself or somebody else ( maybe in defiance to "" bad luck "" , "" devil "" , etc . ) zvjezdana vrzic * * * * *"

subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you 
also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of 
lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of 
both spam and nonspam, then you have it apply the algorithm 
above to the incoming mail stream.  So it could be thousands of 
actual real, different, emails per day.  The ""very high rate 
triggers alarms"" thing is certainly something which would be 
possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to 
exhibit this behavior -- can't think of one right now but ""AOL 
proxy server"" springs to mind as an example from another domain.C-------------------------------------------------------

"summary : borrowing of body part terms many moons ago i posted a query regarding the borrowing of certain body part terms , notably , heart , eye , ear , and tongue , and never posted a summary ( tsk , tsk ) . here it is : first of all , i have been able to find , either through linguist or from other sources , clear examples of almost all the basic body part terms , including ' hand ' ( many iranian languages from persian , ossetic from chechen - ingush ) , ' heart ' ( polish from czech , many indo - aryan and iranian languages from persian , turkish from arabic ) , ' tongue ' ( a whole bunch of ethiopian languages ) , and so on . the one for which i have no completely clearly documented example is ' ear ' ( although there are cases of ' ear ' being replaced by a neologism from within the language itself ) . * * i am thus still looking for an example of borrowing involving the word for ' ear ' . * * a discussion of the whole question of borrowability of body part terms and its relation to language classification ( esp . with reference to the altaic question ) will appear in a paper by alexander vovin and me to appear next year in the zeitschrift der deutschen morgelandischen gesellschaft . finally , i would like to summarize the information provided by those who responded to my original query on linguist , to all of whom my deepest thanks : shirley silver ( silver @ sonoma . edu ) reported that mary haas , having reconstructed proto - hokan ' ear ' ( and ' navel ' ) noted that one could find or reconstruct similar forms in other language families ( penutian , yuki , and the algic languages wiyot & yurok ) , which would seem to suggest borrowing . this is the closest i have come so far to a borrowed ' ear ' . benjamin moore ( ben @ edr5r . edr . co . jp ) reports that in modern japanese , the term for animal tongue used as food is ' tan ' a borrowing of english ' tongue . ' david costa ( dcosta @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) and george aaron broadwell ( g . broadwell @ albany . edu ) note that choctaw _ nishkin _ ' eye ' ( and according to costa other forms in western muskogean ( chickasaw & choctaw , + mobilian jargon ) , are from some algonquian source ( note proto - algonquian * _ ne $ ki : n $ ekwi _ ) , a suggestion which i have found goes back at least to mary haas . however , i should add that ives goddard , whom i asked about this , expressed strong doubt about any such connection . bruce connell ( connellb @ vax . ox . ac . uk ) reported that ' heart ' in usaghade ( lower cross < benue - congo ) is apparently borrowed from a neighbouring bantu language , with semantic shift . tone marking omitted , usaghade ebuma , ' heart ' proto - bantu * - bumo , 's tomach ' . jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) reported that the common word for ' tongue ' in standard chinese and in hmong - mien languages ( generally speaking ) [ hm = miao - yao ] is very likely related , suggesting borrowing , since these languages are not considered genetically linked . norbert strade < lingnost @ hum . aau . dk > reported that the finnish word for "" neck "" , "" kaula "" , is borrowed from baltic . cynthia vakareliyska ( vakarel @ oregon . uoregon . edu ) pointed that some slavists believe that the russian word for ' eye ' ( _ glaz _ ) is borrowed from germany . ( i have been slowly tracing the origin of this opinion , which appears to be in error , but have not yet gotten all the way to the bottom of it . in my view the correct etymology , which is given by several authorities , is a shift in meaning of the native word for 's tone ' , ' boulder ' or the like ) . references from the above : connell , b . ( in press ) the role of language contact in the development of usaghade . to appear in sugia ( sprache und geschichte in afrika ) 16 or 17 , special issue on ' language contact and historical change ' . haas , mary r . 1964 . california hokan . in studies in californian linguistics . william bright , ed . university of california publications in linguistics 34 : 73-87 . jacob , betty ; t . dale nicklas ; and betty lou spencer . 1977 . introduction to choctaw . durant , ok : choctaw bilingual education program , southeastern oklahoma state university ."

"english only i found the remarks of johanna rubba in a recent issue ( 6 . 967 ) to be very worthwhile and to the point . i would like to add a couple of points . in the vast majority of immigrants to the united states , the typical pattern of language acquisition is : the first generation may or may not learn english ; the second generation learns english natively and the parents ' language to varying degrees of proficiency ; the third generation learns only english - - and this is without any legislative intervention . there are strong pedagogical and psycholinguistic reasons for bilingual education programs for school-age immigrants and unassimilated children of immigrants . it is far easier to ` ` learn to read ' ' ( in the general sense , not in the sense of learning to read a particular language ) in one 's native language , and then learn to read the second language , than it is to learn to read ( in the second language ) and to learn the second language at the same time . - stuart luppescu | university of chicago | a foreign language is ` ` a weapon in sl70 @ cicero . spc . uchicago . edu | in the struggle for life .

"next of kin [ business ] goodday , i am frenkel heydorn , staff of smith came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of thirty million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case , i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the united kingdom . he directed that i liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm . i informed him that smith & williamson would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate and made the funds available to the security firm . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited with the security firm . the security firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited with the security firm . the deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th february 2003 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security firm , and i could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate the deceased . i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of smith depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; the deceased died without a testate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . it is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased . my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation . what this means , you being the last batch of names we have considered , is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member . this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit . according to practice , the security firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to smith & williamson , failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to smith & williamson . this will result in the money entering the smith & williamson accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division . this will not happen if i have my way . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is thirty million dollars deposited in a security firm , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as smith they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; you share the same surname with our late client ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the security firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with right to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased i will then officially communicate with the security firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the security firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the security company . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by , for once i find myself in total control of my destiny . these chances wont pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . lets share the blessing . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through this email account if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through this email address . i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man , i have a wife and children . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . i await your response . frenkel heydorn . mail sent from webmail service at php - nuke powered site fanghaowen . com - http : / / fanghaowen . com"

   Version: 3.5
   File size: 6.6MB
   License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X   Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
   under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
   attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
   editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
   film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
   brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
   soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record
   ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
   up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
   production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
   to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on

   File size: 793K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X   Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
   FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
   downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
   full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
   you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
   without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
   program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
   interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
   book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves
   awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=49-ZM4cIEpSenMA07qVX4RVXFO5JSFR    Want to review Captain FTP? Submit your opinion here:

   Version: 1.19
   File size: 1.63MB
   License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X   One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
   organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
   keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
   organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=88-ec5PQQKx6IOkSTY-rU358atSBbiR    Want to review AquilaCalendar? Submit your opinion here:

   translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,
   and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be
   able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client

   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 8.x/OS 9.x/OS X   Remember the classic arcade game Bomberman? Even if you
   don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a
   spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while
   setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll
   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through
   eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10
   subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came
   from. Blast away:   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=07-HqCzI5rq9T_hx8KiqzUbrvLkiDeR    Want to review Boom? Submit your opinion here:

Meanwhile, the administration says that it's open to the idea of a chief privacy officer for the agency.

Apple to expand iMac LCD displayApple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger flat-panel display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show, according to sources.
The upgrade to a 17-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) comes as sales have all but stalled on existing 15-inch flat-panel iMacs. Apple unveiled the original flat-panel iMac, which suspends the monitor from a pivoting arm attached to a hemispherical base, during January's Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which had been trying unsuccessfully to sell the 800,000 accounts since taking them over in February, shut them down after they failed certain performance measures over the past three months, said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman. Although NextCard customers will no longer be able to use their cards to make purchase or cash withdrawals, they will continue to be responsible for their outstanding balances.

"sum : dets and number about a month ago , i posted the following query : i ' m looking for languages whose nps have the following three properties : ( 1 ) bare , unmarked nouns occur in argument position , and may be interpreted as either singular or plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , as opposed to english ) ; ( 2 ) at least some determiners are unmarked for number ( eg . english "" the "" , "" some "" , "" john 's "" , as opposed to "" this "" , "" these "" ) ; and , most interestingly , ( 3 ) when a bare , unmarked noun occurs in construction with a determiner that is unmarked for number , the resulting np * is * marked for number . so far , i am familiar with two languages satisfying the above three conditions . ( both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do n't satisfy these conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" kucing "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiners "" itu "" ( that / the ) and ini "" ( this ) are unmarked for number , eg . "" seekor kucing itu "" ( that / the one cat ) , "" dua ekor kucing itu "" ( those / the two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns in construction with "" itu "" and ini "" tend to be interpreted as singular , eg . "" kucing itu "" ( that / the cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , there is some variation here between speakers , and between different constructions for the same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" cat "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessors such as "" john 's "" are unmarked for number , eg . "" john 's one cat "" ( john 's one cat ) , "" john 's two cat ( s ) "" ( john 's two cats ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors , the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular , eg . "" john 's cat "" ( john 's cat / * cats ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above cases , an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np . are there any cases where the result is a plural np ? ( d ) does anybody have any ideas how to analyze / explain this phenomenon ( within any theoretical framework , or none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this is one case where the summary is much shorter than the query itself . two other languages emerged with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks to pamela a downing and mayumi masuko ) , and korean ( thanks to jae jung song ) . ( in the meantime , further field work of my own revealed that in singlish , not just prenominal possessors but also the definite article "" the "" exhibits a similar singularity effect : although unmarked for number ( as evidenced by "" the one cat "" , "" the two cat ( s ) "" ) , "" the cat "" is interpreted as singular . ) further observations were provided by steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark a . mandel , edith a . moravcsik , and gwyn williams ."

I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the Digital 
Edition and see if you like reading the mag in that 
format better than the print variety. A Software and 
Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
last belated visit.I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
opinion. See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
LDAP Whodunit
Pondered by Warren Dugas""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""History of LDAP http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp
X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications. DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windowsï¿½ operating system or the Macintosh. The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

Looking for Sound
Suggested by Corey Holletthttp://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html
""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point.""
Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an ""initial"" 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html
WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

"re : 5 . 1414 native speaker intuitions i would like to make a few comments on marilyn silva 's questions about control structures like ( 1 ) johnny asked the teacher to go to the bathroom . ( 2 ) johnny asked to go to the movies . which , at least for some native speakers , are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller . i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics ( no syntax needed here ) . first , it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the "" unmarked "" case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause . therefore , the first option is object control . in the case of ( 1 ) this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors , such as the relative social status of the participants ( student vs . teacher ) . it is relatively unlikely ( though not excluded ) that the student will ask the teacher to do something . therefore , it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation . in the case of ' ask ' = a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request , i . e . the asker . the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request . johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation "" going to the bathroom "" . thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of = the infinitive complement . similarly , for a sentence like ( 3 ) john asked paula to be assigned for the task . which seems to involve control switch , i . e . switch from object control to subject control . in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent . therefore , it 's implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object . but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries . well , not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theta-role theory but in the sense of speech act semantics . what seems to at work here is a principle of "" role identity "" , which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus - michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica 27 . 57-105 . ( "" a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german "" ) . roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as "" pragmatic roles "" . we also point out some interesting differences = between control in english and german , for example , that sentences like ( 4 ) der polizist bat , den saal zu verlassen . ( literally : the policeman asked to leave the room ) can only be interpeted as involving an "" implicit controller "" , i . e . an addresse or a set of addressees , which is not lexicalized . related issues are also discussed in my recent book "" kontrollph = e4nomene im englischen und deutschen aus semantisch-pragmatischer perspektive "" published by gunter narr verlag , tuebingen . by the way , koepcke and i found that native speaker 's intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not . klaus panther , university of hamburg , germany"

Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?==
http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002."

remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : "" the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net "" order report # 1 from : robert borowczyk ul . j . olbrachta 118 c m . 28 01 - 373 warsaw poland report # 2 : "" the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net "" order report # 2 from : mohammad faraziyan engelbertstr . 25 40233 düsseldorf germany report # 3 : "" secret to multilevel marketing on the net "" order report # 3 from : luis pastor apartado 81 48080 bilbao spain report # 4 : "" how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net "" order report # 4 from : ali reza auf den holln 68 44894 bochum germany report # 5 : "" how to send out one million emails for free "" order report # 5 from : j . siden krondikesvägen 54 a 83147 östersund sweden $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you do not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in !

verlag as volume 862 of the lectures notes in artificial intelligence , and the third international colloquium on grammatical inference , held at montpellier in france , the proceedings of which were published by springer - verlag as volume 1147 of the lecture notes in artificial intelligence . following the success of these events and the workshop on automata induction , grammatical inference , and language acquisition , held in conjunction with the international conference on machine learning at nashville in united states in july 1997 , the fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference will be held from july 12 through july 14 , 1998 , at iowa state university in united states . -

"> Wrong, [VMS-like async io] makes a huge difference in even what I
> consider small programs.So it sounds as if, to your thinking,
most useful apps are also trivial. 
Unless each key on my keyboard were
(to the apps) distinct event sources,
I can't think of any of my usual job
mix that would need hundreds, or even
tens, of async requests; perhaps you
can explain how nontrivial apps will
be compellingly useful? > but it's still not built in, who knows when it will be. The point is it's
> not portable in either case.Does that lack of portability imply it
isn't generally useful?  (When it was
apparent that TCP networks were useful,
berkeley sockets could be found even
on VMS and Win 3.1 boxen)Why would early Unix have run with the
idea that, if one wishes to do multiple
things at the same time, one can use a
group of processes to do them?- they had Multics as a counterexample?- in the days of tiny memories and tapes,
  people were more accustomed to writing
  programs that didn't run entirely in a
  single address space?- one is a great number for an interface,
  as log(1) is 0, and specification can
  be implicit?- some combination of the above?Now, as Hoare says:
> There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make
> it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
> make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.As programmers, we've been able to make
our lives complicated for at least half
a century; the hardware interrupt gives
us the rope.Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE
was the counterexample of IBM's multi-
programmed boxes (were these the same
ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
and I suppose he would say the question
is how not to make a mess of it -- how
should we structure computations so if
we try to do ten times as many things
at the same time, reasoning about the
resulting system is at most ten times
more complex -- not one hundred, and
certainly not three and a half million
times more.Compared to that project, the prospect
of writing a driver library for various
vendors' aio implementations seems to
be truly trivial.-Dave(Oracle, in their quest for portability,
used to use raw disks for the database.
This finessed the filesystem issue; did
it also allow them to roll their own set
of async drivers?)

"Thank you for your interest!Judgment Coursesoffers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in

report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the 
one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the 
majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your 
trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither 
against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change. So your
""gray"" mail won't have much influence on your trust (neither good nor 
bad, just... gray)-------------------------------------------------------

"THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
Believe it, work it. 
This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
try!! 
You will be glad you did. 
Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
IN HIS CLOSET! 
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
You most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year"". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
and I started sending it out"", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work"", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 
goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
carry it all"". 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework"". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, ""Please send me report number 
XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee. 
[This is the end of the media release. If you would 
like to understand how the system works and get your 
$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 
instructions]. 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
================================================== 
You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
home!! 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
=========================================================
=======Here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first:

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily 
and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and 
AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$ 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME 
TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
=========================================================
======= 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
=========================================================
======= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
=========================================================
======= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT 
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
=========================================================
======= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the report. 
===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 
========================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always 
send 
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 
one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 
are ordering, 
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

====================== MORE 
TESTIMONIALS====================== 
'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
on me! 
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
joined 
Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
=========================================================
======= '' Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised

"re : releasing different versions of vatrfacs code winston and jin , for last half year the following developments were implemented by jin for vatrfacs code ( the calibration code for var ) : 1 . weighting the log - returns with exponential decay factor while calculating correlations ; 2 . calculating factors and correlations for uk curves ; 3 . joint estimation of factor loading for selected groups of commodities ; 4 . alternative method for collecting historical data for correlations calculation ( based on fixed contract instead of collecting prompt , prompt + 1 , etc . prices ) in order to release these developments research has to have each version under clearcase . then we will : 1 . run vatrfacs code in stage environment ( stage has been refreshed recently ) . 2 . run var code in stage and validate the results . it is time to start releasing these 4 versions . projects 3 and 4 require some experimental runs in stage . a few traders ( in gas , power and liquids markets ) are expecting the results . meanwhile the following developments have been suggested by reseach , approved by risk control , submitted to it as spreadsheet prototypes and waiting in line : 1 . volatility blending for intramonth power positions ; 2 . forward volatility smoothing and extracting forward forward volatilities ; hope we can follow our procedures to make all these developments go smoothly and efficiently . tanya ."

This was an announcement of a public event by our building owners, with a text part that was the same as the HTML (AFAICT). Its language may be spammish, but the content-type clues didn't help.

I poked around expedia for availability from March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday). I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially responsible for unbooked rooms). Most hotels are less than responsive... Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle) $125/night, $99/weekend State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU) $119/night, $99/weekend Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD) $99/hight, $74/weekend Windsor Park Hotel Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations $95/night; needs a car Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA) $95/nightThis is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates. Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only discount. I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either.I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.Z. """"""This one has no MIME structure nor HTML! It even has a Content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue. It got f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related terms. I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.

The first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-). It has lots of HTML clues that are apparently ignored. It was a multipart/mixed with two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a mondo weird URL:http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was the HTML taken directly from the above URL.

"books on functional linguistics john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the four following titles in the field of functional linguistics : reconnecting language : morphology and syntax in functional perspectives a . . - m . simon - vandenbergen , k . davidse and d . niel ( eds ) ( univ . of gent / univ . of leuven / univ . of gent ) 1997 . xii , 212 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 154 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 870 1 price : usd 79 . 00 rest of the world : hb 90 272 3659 3 price : nlg 158 , - - although the contributors to this book do not belong to one particular 's chool ' of linguistic theory , they all share an interest in the external functions of language in society and in the relationship between these functions and internal linguistic phenomena . in this sense , they all take a functional approach to grammatical issues . apart from this common starting-point , the contributions share the aim of demonstrating the non-autonomous nature of morphology and syntax , and the inadequacy of linguistic models which deal with syntax , morphology and lexicon in separate , independent components . the recurrent theme throughout the book is the inseparability of lexis and morphosyntax , of structure and function , of grammar and society . the third and more specific common thread is case , which in some contributions is adduced to illustrate the more general point of the link between word form on the one hand and clausal and textual relations on the other hand , while in other papers it is at the centre of the discussion . the interest of the proposed volume consists in the fact that it brings together the views of leading scholars in functional linguistics of various 'd enominations ' on the place of morphosyntax in linguistic theory . the book provides convincing argumentation against a modular theory with autonomous levels ( the dominant framework in mainstream 20th century linguistics ) and is a plea for further research into the connections between the lexicogrammar and the linguistic and extra-linguistic context . contributions by : m . a . k . halliday ;

noun plus causative-like suffix expressing the ' give ' concept in nahuatl ; ' give ' and other ditransitive constructions in zulu ; the complex verbal morphologies associated with ' give ' verbs in chipewyan , cora , and sochiapan chinantec ; the elaborate classificatory system found with ' give ' verbs in chipewyan and cora ; ' give ' , ' have ' and ' take ' constructions in slavic languages ; the expression of ' give ' in american sign language ; the origin of the german es gibt construction ; the extension of ' give ' to an adverbial marker in thai , khmer , and vietnamese ; the syntax and semantics of dutch ' give ' ; first language acquisition of possession terms . contributions by : john robert , david tuggy , john taylor , sally rice , eugene casad , phyllis perrin wilcox , david foris , laura janda , theo janssen , john newman , jae jung song , and michael tomasello . information status and noncanonical word order in english . betty birner & gregory ward 1998 xiv 314 pp . studies in language companion series 40 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 926 0 price : 69 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3043 9 price : nlg 138 , - - this work provides a comprehensive discourse-functional account of three classes of noncanonical constituent placement in english - preposing , postposing , and argument reversal - and shows how their interaction is accounted for in a principled and predictive way . in doing so , it details the variety of ways in which information can be ' given ' or new ' and shows how an understanding of this variety allows us to account for the distribution of these constructions in discourse . moreover , the authors show that there exist broad and empirically verifiable functional correspondences within classes of syntactically similar constructions . relying heavily on corpus data , the authors identify three interacting dimensions along which individual constructions may vary with respect to the pragmatic constraints to which they are sensitive : old vs . new information , relative vs . absolute familiarity , and discourse - vs . hearer-familiarity . they show that preposed position is reserved for information that is linked to the prior discourse by means of a contextually licensed partially-ordered set relationship ; postposed position is reserved for information that is ' new ' in one of a small number of distinct senses ; and argument-reversing constructions require that the information represented by the preverbal constituent be at least as familiar within the discourse as that represented by the postverbal constituent . within each of the three classes of constructions , individual constructions vary with respect to whether they are sensitive to familiarity within the discourse or ( assumed ) familiarity within the hearer 's knowledge store . thus , although the individual constructions in question are subject to distinct constraints , this work provides empirical evidence for the existence of strong correlations between sentence position and information status . the final chapter presents crosslinguistic data showing that these correlations are not limited to english . the structure of the lexicon in functional grammar hella olbertz , kees hengeveld & jesus sanchez garcia ( eds . ) ( university of amsterdam ) 1998 . xii , 312 pp . studies in language companion series , 43 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 929 5 price : usd 69 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3046 3 price : nlg 138 , - - the papers collected in this volume concern five different aspects of the role of the lexicon in the theory of functional grammar as developed by simon c . dik and his co-workers . the volume starts off with a practical introduction to the functional - lexematic model and model applications to english , german and spanish are presented . the second part of the volume deals with the derivation of action-nouns , pseudo-reflexive verbs and causative constructions , thus offering new perspectives on predicate formation within functional grammar . this is followed by a section that centers around an important problem related to valency : the question of how to account for the collocational properties of predicates . the fourth part of the book discusses ( non-prototypical ) transitive verbs and their relation to the typology of states of affairs . the final section focuses on the relationship between the lexicon and the underlying structure of the clause . check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /"

What are you trying to sell???? What is the Value???Example...Does Pratchett sell paper bound by glue or does he sell stories?Question...When I buy a book have I purchased the story? When I sell the
book does any of that revenue go to mr Pratchett?What if I read the book and  give it to someone, who then reads it
and gives it  to someone who then reads it and gives it to
someones....(bookcrossing.com though with  more succesfull passings). Does
each reader send Mr Pratchett money?Have Used Bookstores, Recorstores etc destroyed the system of book/record
economy?AS to the resident sourpuss, in germany bitter may be better but here its
just plain stinkin thinkin.

to be part of the syntax, rather than a control flow modifier.A _mandatory_ part of the syntax, at that.Later,

"Xander Blakley quotes a Russian joke in his terrific book _Siberia Bound_. 
Frenchman, American, and Russian get to talking bout which country has the 
more desireable women. Frenchman says, ""Ah, when a Frenchman puts his hands 
around zee waist of his lover, his fingers form a complete circle and 
touch--not because his hands are so large, but because zee  French woman's 
waist is so slender.""
    American says ""Yep, but when an American woman gets on a horse, her heels 
reach all the way down to the ground--and it's not because American horses 
are short, but because American women have such endlessly long, sexy legs.""
    Russian says: ""Da, but when a Russian slaps his wife's ass on his way out 
of the house in the morning, it's still jiggling when he comes back after 
work--and it's not because her ass is so big, but because the Russian work 
day is so short.""Tom

"safety bulletin the team concept has given us numerous opportunities for improvements over the past several years with team members continuing to be recognized and rewarded for their positive efforts and accomplishments . as accomplishments are made , trust and responsibilities increase , and the team experiences growth , maturity , and the associated rewards . a part of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of the teams responsibility to monitor and enforce company policies and procedures . as you heard from me in 2000 , i will protect those who are complying with and enforcing our requirements , but i have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so . along with the rewards for positive efforts , there are also consequences for those who fail to act when circumstances call for action . during the year 2000 , several ets employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act and / or ignoring safe work practices . these cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a safety bulletin . it has been my intention that we all learn from these instances to make our work place even safer . as we publish this first , and hopefully only , safety bulletin in 2001 , i would like to share with you two instances from last year . after repeatedly counseling a fellow team member observed violating several safety requirements ( including hard hat , safety glasses , frc ) , one team took action , which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged . while this may seem to be a harsh outcome , it is much better than the person injuring themselves , or even worse , a fellow team member . this person had others expressing concern over his well - being and chose to ignore the warnings . individual team members acted on their responsibility and the team as a whole accepted their accountability . in the second case , a team member chose to drive a company vehicle without using a seatbelt . the employee was involved in an accident ejecting him from the vehicle , causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt would have been properly used . this employee is lucky to be alive . use of seat belts by all occupants of company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over 20 years . as the use of seat belts is habit forming , could this have been the first time the employee failed to use them ? is it possible that other team members had observed this failure in the past and not acted ? could this have been prevented through positive interaction ? had positive interaction been taken but ignored ? when the declaration of interdependence was introduced in 1998 , we made the commitment to each other that we would be our brothers and sisters keeper and to remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times . while some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements , that does not relieve the person from their responsibility . likewise , a team is responsible and accountable for the actions ( or lack of a required action ) of each team member . each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to take . please assist us in creating the safest work environment possible . our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night , and should expect nothing less from peers or members of your leadership to hold you accountable for doing just that ."

"" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it would n't work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her "" hobby .

"the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried. We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of. We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts. We can use private investigators. Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners). But, they're not secret agents. They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of businessHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before. Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark.Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours. Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars. But only if we're given a chance to succeed. - dan -- Dan Kohn -----Original Message----- From: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38 To: Matthew Cline Cc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why? Matthew Cline writes:> There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are > planning on making money from the spam. What a court would consider > evidence of being the spammer is another question.Haha!!!Just a few notes: - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information! I don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright. Also, some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example, ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way.Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications platform!

"" "" and with the release of my new book , ' multiple streams of income ' i ' m on the prowl again - looking for a small , select group of ordinary people who want my help in creating instant wealth like i have for countless others ! if you qualify , there ' s only one small , reasonable catch : "" i will use your new cash flow success story in my upcoming promotions . so if you can live with that ' catch ' - then you must stop everything you ' re doing and read the rest of this letter right now "" ( important : you must respond to this invitation within the next 60 minutes . due to the time - sensitive nature of this opportunity , we must release your reserved slot to someone else if you do not respond within the allotted time . ) invitation clock count - down you must r . s . v . p . within minutes dear friend seeking financial independence and personal freedom , hi . my names robert allen . i ' m the author of two of the best selling financial books in history ; both # 1 new york times best sellers : nothing down creating wealth my books have sold over 2 . 5 million copies , over 150 , 000 people have attended my wealth seminars , and i ' ve accepted challenges by the press and have proven time and again that my money making strategies work . in fact , recently i was challenged again on national tv . it was in front of a live audience . i was challenged to take someone from regis philbins studio audience and teach them my wealth building strategies and guess what ? just 90 days after following my systems , pat watson was $ 20 , 000 wealthier ! listen , you ' ve heard all the get rich now claims and you ' re sick of seeing them ! the fact is most of those people who claim to know how you can make money haven ' t made much money themselves let alone taught others how to do it ! the difference between them and me is that i ' ve proven my strategies time and time again in the national limelight and my systems truly work in fact , i ' ve been dubbed america ' s # 1 millionaire maker . right now , america and i need you for my upcoming nationwide tour to share your story of upcoming success and wealth to those who need hope - all across america . let me tell you about a few of my "" money challenges "" . . . this is where i put my money where my mouth is : i was also challenged by the los angeles times : you might remember when the los angeles times challenged me to buy real estate with nothing down . with a reporter by my side , $ 100 for living expenses , and armed only with my knowledge ; i purchased 7 properties worth $ 772 , 000 , all in 57 hours . i told the mayor of st louis missouri ( the show me state ) : send me to any unemployment line . let me select someone who is broke , out of work , discouraged . let me teach him in two days time the secrets of wealth , and in 90 days he ' ll be back on his feet , with $ 5 , 000 cash in the bank , never to set foot in an employment line again . i selected a young couple from the unemployment lines of st . louis , missouri . ninety days later they earned $ 5 , 000 using one of my techniques , and . . . . within 12 months they had earned over $ 100 k ! my proudest moments are when i coach starving millionaires ( people who should be millionaires but aren ' t ) on wealth building strategies and see them achieve extraordinary results , again and again ! i ' ve done these same challenges in other major cities - washington , d . c . , miami , boston , san diego , and new york - all with similar results ! this brings me to my next challenge in which i took all of the hype out of the high - powered profit potential of the internet , and decided to make it a reality for my students . i said : sit me at any key board of any computer in the world with internet access , and i will in 24 hours , earn at least $ 24 , 000 cash ! i got myself into the life or death mindset and i went to work i started my internet challenge at exactly at 12 : 38 pm in front of live television , i held my breath , and turned my system on and signed on to the internet in 6 hours and 11 minutes i had generated $ 46 , 684 . 95 then i went to sleep . . . and when i woke up the next morning and checked the computer - ( with cameras rolling ) : the total was now $ 78 , 827 . 44 this was exciting because i knew i still had four hours left ! that afternoon , 24 hours after the challenge had begun . . . the total had grown to $ 94 , 532 . 44 in a mere 24 hours ! why do i tell you all of this ? well its certainly not to brag but its to prove that i practice what i teach ! and since i ' m ready to announce my next challenge , i thought you ' d like to hear my success story - and how i can help you regardless of where you are in your financial life . so heres my newest challenge : send me a group of people who want to become financially independent . let me teach them my proven , wealth building strategies . and in 90 days , they will have developed multiple streams of income . eventually these streams of income may give them the freedom to do what ever they want for the rest of their lives . thats my newest challenge and i want you to be a part of it . you have everything it takes to break the mold of an average income earner but you just need to decide to do it ! listen , i know the reason you ' re still reading this letter is because you believe there still is hope theres still a chance a glimmer of hope that you can be a millionaire . its hard to leave your comfort zone . but you can do it and i will help you . but first , let me tell you about a few people who ' ve had the courage to follow their instinct , break out of their comfort zones , and follow my advice : robert , my life was never the same again here ' s the incredible news : only one year after using your strategies , ( coincidentally our twelfth wedding anniversary , ) we became millionaires , yes , a million dollars in equity ! wow ! depending on what time frame you measure from , that ' s either ' incredibly fast ' or ' miraculously fast ' ! six months from picking up your book , four - plus months from becoming protgs , two months and nine days after quitting my job ! that takes my breath away ! . . . this letter stands as testimony to your accomplishments . . . robert , thank you , thank you , thank you ! - - karen n . b . , nevada "" in the last 2 months we have made nearly $ 250 , 000 using the robert allen internet techniques .

"eskimo words for "" snow "" , "" ice "" , etc . as an eskimologist and an anthropologist , i strongly concur with woodbury 's and hill 's recent messages on the topic . i have two responses : one to the person who suggested that maybe what was peculiar about eskimo words for snow is not the number of lexical items to be found in a dictionary , but rather that these words are used more often and even by non-specialists within the culture . i am sorry that i can't track down the name of this person , which i must have deleted by mistake . but this is an interesting idea . my answer is that eskimos talk about snow about as often as a sahara tuareg would talk about rain , in other words , not very often . remember that the arctic is technically a desert ; i . e . there is very little precipitation , although whatever snow that does fall remains on the ground , an ~ rd is blown a } iround into funny shapes , for which there is of course , a technical terminology , used mainly by huntersd who need to use these things as landmarks . snow ( as a ground cover or falling ) is really not very important to eskimos . i suggest that we start looking at some of the languages of the subarctic groups of canada ( cree , chipewyan ) , these people live in deep snow , and probably talk about it a lot more ! my second response is for george fowler who suggest that there might be an fashion of eskimo words for - - - - - going on . he talks about 50 words for ice in greenlandic . he was speaking facetiously , of course , but there is a point to be made here . eskimos who hunt on ice ( such as the siberian yupik eskimos i worked with ) have an incredibly detailed technical terminology for ice conditions , icebergs , ice thickness and movements . for eskimo hunters , these things are concretely a matter of life and death . so eskimos do have many words for ice , and as for snow , this is a technical terminology , and as for snow , it is entirely based on a few stems that actually mean "" ice "" , and on many stems that do not fundamentally mean "" ice "" . so , at least in some eskimo languages , such as cnetral siberian yupik eskimo , there are actually more expressions ( or if you want "" words "" ) for "" ice "" than for "" snow "" . for the definition of a "" word "" and "" stem "" in eskimo , i refer y ' all back to woodbury 's statement . the point is that technical terminology for things that interest eskimos is no different from technical terminology that is relevant to , say , swiss cuckoo clock makers . willem j . de reuse dept . of anthropology university of arizona tucson , az 85721"

choice I've found) but I grant you that: No language is the be-all and
end-all.I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for
24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of
code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to
maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much as
I've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've never
ever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to be
responsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I am
so sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've been
using C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found
any decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in
the task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by no
means perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party
libs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really
hate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll
together a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing a
stream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relational
databases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open an
XMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Where
can I find C libs for those components?  On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socket
which can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodically
refresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,
presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, and
again, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langauge
but Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's not
ready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in C
is just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?
Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How do
you evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and
trying it out?In a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see the
social infrastructure for either happening during my professional
lifetime.    R> Why do so many people outside of Sun's marketing department
    R> consider Java to be ""Write Once, Debug Everywhere"" ?A collegue at Cognos (Henk?) called C ""the nearly-portable assembler""--

"I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk to another.
However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it. The problem is the bulk of
the data is images and most of these image have two directory entries i.e.
there is a hard link to each file. If I copy them using cp -a or my usual
favourite of find .|cpio -pmd other_dir it's going to copy each file twice,
which is not what I want. dump / restore would take care of this if the
source filesystem wasn't reiserfs :-( Any suggestions ?

   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.Dan
